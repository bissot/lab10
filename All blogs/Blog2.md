I have do some more vue tutorials to learn the framework some more. This will allow me to really understand vue, 
when I do finally contribute code to the project. I also created some style guidelines to the project, to allow 
new contributors to understand how the project code looks. I just tried to base the style guidelines off of the
code that I have seen in the project so far.
