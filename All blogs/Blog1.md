For this first week, I was working on doing some vue tutorials to get updated on how the framework for vue works.
I do have expirence on how to develop front end pages, but I want to really understand the framework, 
So it will be easier to contribute to the project. I also created some contributing guidelines that will 
apply to the project based on the ones in the atom project.
