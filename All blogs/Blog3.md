In the instance of the return of Richard Stallman to the FSF, I think that nowadays, organizations have a tough decision to make. 
They need to decide if someone should separate the artist from the art. 
This is a situation where, this person is such an advocate for the freedom of software in the modern era, 
that they can truly make an impact on the situation of free software in today’s age. 
The problem is if that person can truly make their impact based on their past events. 
I think that since he was reintroduced, that the FSF made their decision being that despite his past mistakes, 
his impact that he can make, is greater than these mistakes.
