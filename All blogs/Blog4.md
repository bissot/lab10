For the last week I have create a compoment for a settings page. It is style like the rest of the pages, and
include a text field for modifying the first name, last name, email, and password for an account. I also added
a submission button to the field, however these compomnents where not connect to the back end out of fear of 
breaking something. I also had some troubles trying to log in so I created a bug report for that.
